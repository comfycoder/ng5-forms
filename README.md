# Camp Comfy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

See [Demo](https://comfycoder.github.io/camp-comfy/)

The purpose of this site is to provide working examples of the angular-cli setup tasks and code I discussed in my presentation, "Take Your Angular App Glamping", which I gave at THAT Conference 2017.
